# PolutionGame

This is a simple simulation of the polution game - a classroom game depicting the effects of polutant emissions and various polices enacted to mitigate them.

In this instance, there are four factories in four adjacent regions. Each factory, at each round, receives subsidies, produces profit and emits polutants to its' region's atmosphere.

The simulation continues as long as there is at least one ecosystem alive. All the possible combinations of the factories' policies are tested.

Bolw are presented the results of the simulations
